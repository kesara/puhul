Even if subsequent router vendors fixed these implementations, ECN was still disabled on end nodes, and given the trade-off between the benefits of enabling ECN (somewhat better behavior during congestion) and the risks of enabling ECN (possibly crashing a router somewhere along the path), ECN tended to stay disabled on implementations that supported ECN for decades afterwards.<a href="#section-6.9.1-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
