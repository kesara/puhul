<    Much of the security of delegation depends on the implementation of the encompassing semantics described in <a href="#deleg" class="xref">Section 4</a>. When delegating from an SPC-based TNAuthList to a set of telephone number ranges, understanding the encompassing semantics may require access to industry databases that track the numbering assets of service providers associated with a given SPC. In some operating environments, such databases might not exist. How encompassing is policed is therefore a matter outside the scope of this document and specific to operational profiles of STIR.<a href="#section-12-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<  It is considered a useful feature here due to the potential dynamism of large lists of telephone numbers, but this dynamism means that a relying party might at one point accept that a particular telephone number is associated with a certificate but later reject it for the same certificate as the dynamic list changes. Also note that if the HTTPS service housing the by-reference telephone number list is improperly secured, that too can lead to vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the CA that issued a delegated certificate populates the URL in the AIA field and is responsible for making a secure selection.
