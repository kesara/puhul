Given that the 5G system, as specified in <span>[<a href="#TS23.501" class="cite xref">TS23.501</a>]</span> (Appendix G.4), encourages the use of name-based routing in the (5G) control plane for realizing the 5G-specific service-based architecture for control plane services (so-called network function service), it would be worthwhile to investigate whether the 4G control plane would benefit similarly from such use or whether specific 4G architectural constraints would prevent ICN from providing any notable benefit.<a href="#section-6.1-2.5" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
