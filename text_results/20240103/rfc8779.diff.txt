<          piece of information is used with the encoding type and signal
<          type to fully describe the switching technology and data
<          carried by the TE-LSP.  This is applicable to the TE-LSP itself
<          and also to the TE-LSP endpoint (carried in the END-POINTS
<          object for MPLS networks in [RFC5440]) when considering
<          multiple network layers.  Inter-layer path computation
<          requirements are addressed in [RFC8282], which focuses on the

<          can be specified on each link and also on the TE-LSP endpoints,
<          in WSON networks, for instance, as described in [RFC6163].  The
<          label restriction can apply to endpoints, and on each hop, the
