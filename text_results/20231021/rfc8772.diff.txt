<          CUPS procedures.  Once the Ci parameters are configured on a
<          UP, it will start to set up S-CUSP sessions with the specified
<          CPs.  The detailed definition of S-CUSP session establishment
<          can be found in Section 4.1.1.
< 
<    (2)   Board and interface report: Once the S-CUSP session is
<          established between the UP and a CP, the UP will report status
<          information on the boards and subscriber-facing interfaces of
<          this UP to the CP.  A board can also be called a Line/Service
<          Process Unit (LPU/SPU) card.  The subscriber-facing interfaces
<          refer to the interfaces that connect the access network nodes
<          (e.g., Optical Line Terminal (OLT), DSLAM, etc.).  The CP can
<          use this information to enable the Broadband Access Server
<          (BAS) function (e.g., IPoE, PPPoE, etc.) on the specified
<          interfaces.  See Sections 4.2.1 and 7.10 for more details on
<          resource reporting.
< 
<    (3)   BAS function enable: To enable the BAS function on the
<          specified interfaces of a UP.
< 
<    (4)   Subscriber network route advertisement: The CP will allocate
<          one or more IP address blocks to a UP.  Each address block
<          contains a series of IP addresses.  Those IP addresses will be
<          allocated to subscribers who are dialing up from the UP.  To
<          enable other nodes in the network to learn how to reach the
<          subscribers, the CP needs to notify the UP to advertise to the
<          network the routes that can reach those IP addresses.

<          up request, it will relay the request packet to a CP through
<          the Si.  The CP will parse the request.  If everything is OK,
<          it will send an authentication request to the AAA server to
<          authenticate the subscriber.  Once the subscriber passes the
<          authentication, the AAA server will return a positive response
<          to the CP.  Then the CP will send the dial-up response packet
<          to the UP, and the UP will forward the response packet to the
<          subscriber (RG).  At the same time, the CP will create a
<          subscriber session on the UP, enabling the subscriber to access
<          the network.  For different access types, the process may be a
<          bit different, but the high-level process is similar.  For each
<          access type, the detailed process can be found in Section 5.
