<    R (Reverse LSP, 1 bit, bit number 31):  Indicates whether the LSP
<       associated is the reverse LSP of the bidirectional LSP.  If this
<       flag is set, the LSP is a reverse LSP.  If this flag is not set,
<       the LSP is a forward LSP.
< 
<    C (Co-routed Path, 1 bit, bit number 30):  Indicates whether the
<       bidirectional LSP is co-routed.  This flag MUST be set for both
<       the forward and reverse LSPs of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.
