<    Simplified-inline method:  Include the needed information as part of

<       are used.

<    URI method:  Include a URI that references another YANG instance data
<       file.  This instance data file will use the same content-schema as
<       the referenced YANG instance data file (if you don't want to
<       repeat the info again and again).
