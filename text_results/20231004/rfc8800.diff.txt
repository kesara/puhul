<       P (Shortest Path) bit:  When set, this indicates that the computed

<          objective functions first without considering the diversity
<          constraint.  This means that all of the LSPs with P flag set in

<          those LSPs fixed, the other LSPs with P flag unset in the

<       T (Strict Disjointness) bit:  When set, if disjoint paths cannot
<          be found, the PCE MUST return no path for LSPs that could not
<          be disjoint.  When unset, the PCE is allowed to relax
<          disjointness by either applying a requested objective function
<          (cf. Section 5.3) or using the local policy if no objective
<          function is requested (e.g., using a lower disjoint type (link
<          instead of node) or fully relaxing disjointness constraint).
