<    Name Resolution Service (NRS):  An NRS in ICN is defined as a service
<       that provides the function of translating a content name or a data
<       object name into some other information such as a routable prefix,
<       a locator, an off-path-cache pointer, or an alias name that is
<       more amenable than the input name to forwarding the object request
<       toward the target destination storing the NDO [RFC9138].  An NRS
<       is most likely implemented through the use of a distributed
<       mapping database system.  The Domain Name System (DNS) may be used
<       as an NRS.  However, in this case, the requirements of frequent
<       updates of NRS records due to the creations of a lot of new NDOs
<       and changes in their locations in the network need to be
<       considered.
< 
<    NRS server:  An NRS comprises the distributed NRS servers storing the
<       mapping records in their databases.  NRS servers store and
<       maintain the mapping records that keep the mappings of content or
<       object name to some other information that is used for forwarding
<       the content request or the content itself.
< 
<    NRS resolver:  The client-side function of an NRS is called an NRS
<       resolver.  The NRS resolver is responsible for initiating name
<       resolution request queries that ultimately lead to a name
<       resolution of the target data objects.  NRS resolvers can be
<       located in the consumer (or client) nodes and/or ICN routers.  An
<       NRS resolver may also cache the mapping records obtained through
<       the name resolution for later usage.
< 
<    Name registration:  In order to populate the NRS, the content names
<       and their mapping records must be registered in the NRS system by
<       a publisher who has access rights to at least one authoritative
<       NRS server or by a producer who generates named data objects.  The
<       records contain the mapping of an object name to some information
<       such as other alias names, routable prefixes, and locators, which
<       are used for forwarding the content request.  Thus, a publisher or
<       producer of content creates an NRS registration request and sends
<       it to an NRS server.  On registration, the NRS server stores (or
<       updates) the name mapping record in the database and sends an
<       acknowledgement back to the producer or publisher that made the
<       registration request.
< 
<    Name resolution:  Name resolution is the main function of the NRS
<       system.  It is performed by an NRS resolver, which can be deployed
<       on a consumer node or an ICN router.  Resolvers are responsible
<       for either returning a cached mapping record (whose lifetime has
<       not expired) or alternatively sending a name resolution request
<       toward an NRS server.  The NRS server searches for the content
<       name in its mapping record database and, if found, retrieves the
<       mapping record and returns it in a name resolution response
<       message to the NRS resolver.
< 
<    NRS node:  NRS servers are also referred to as NRS nodes that
<       maintain the name records.  The terms are used interchangeably.
< 
<    NRS client:  A node that uses the NRS is called an NRS client.  Any
<       node that initiates a name registration, resolution, or update
<       procedure is an NRS client; that is, NRS resolvers, ICN client
<       nodes, ICN routers, or producers can be NRS clients.

<    Routing scalability:  In ICN, application names identifying content
<       are intended to be used directly for packet delivery, so ICN
<       routers run a name-based routing protocol to build name-based
<       routing and forwarding tables.  Similar to the scalability
<       challenge of IP routing, if non-aggregatable name prefixes are
<       injected into the Default Route Free Zone (DFZ) of ICN routers,
<       they would be driving the uncontrolled growth of the DFZ routing
<       table size.  Thus, providing the level of indirection enabled by
<       an NRS in ICN can be an approach to keeping the routing table size
<       under control.  The NRS system resolves name prefixes that do not
<       exist in the DFZ forwarding table into globally routable prefixes
<       such as the one proposed in NDN [Afanasyev].  Another approach
<       dealing with routing scalability is the Multi-level Distributed
<       Hash Table (MDHT) used in NetInf [Dannewitz].  It provides name-
<       based anycast routing that can support a non-hierarchical
<       namespace and can be adopted on a global scale [Dannewitz2].
< 
<    Producer mobility:  In ICN, if a producer moves into a different name
<       domain that uses a different name prefix, the request for a
<       content produced by the moving producer with the origin content
<       name must be forwarded to the moving producer's new location.
<       Especially in a hierarchical naming scheme, producer mobility
<       support is much harder than in a flat naming scheme since the
<       routing tables in a broader area need to be updated to track the
<       producer movement.  Therefore, various ICN architectures such as
<       NetInf [Dannewitz] and MobilityFirst [MF] have adopted NRS systems
<       to tackle the issues of producers whose location changes.
< 
<    Off-path caching:  In-network caching is a common feature of an ICN
<       architecture.  Caching approaches can be categorized into on-path
<       caching and off-path caching, according to the location of caches
<       in relation to the forwarding path from the original content store
<       to a consumer.  Off-path caching, sometimes also referred to as
<       content replication or content storing, aims to replicate a Named
<       Data Object in various locations within a network in order to
<       increase the availability of content, reduce access latency, or
<       both.  These caching locations may not be lying along the content

<    Forwarding procedure:  When an NRS is included in an ICN
<       architecture, the name resolution procedure has to be included in
<       the ICN overall routing and forwarding architectural procedures.
<       To integrate an NRS into an ICN architecture, there are certain

<    Name registration:  Name registration is performed by the producer
<       (as an NRS client) when it creates a new content.  When a producer
<       creates content and assigns a name from its name prefix space to
<       the content, the producer performs the name registration in an NRS
<       node.  Name registration may be performed by an ICN router when
<       the ICN architecture supports off-path caching or cooperative
<       caching since involving an NRS may be a good idea for off-path
<       caching.  The ICN routers with forwarder caches do not require
<       name registration for their cached content because they lie on the
<       path toward an upstream content store or producer.  They will be
<       hit when a future request is forwarded to the content producer by
<       an ICN router lying downstream toward the ICN client node.
<       However, ICN routers performing off-path caching of content must
<       invoke the name registration procedure so that other ICN routers
<       can depend on name resolutions to know about the off-path cache
<       locations.  If a content gets cached in many off-path ICN routers,
<       all of them may register the same content names in the same NRS
<       node, resulting in multiple registration actions.  In this case,
<       the NRS node adds the new location of the content to the name
<       record together with the previous locations.  In this way, each of
<       the name records stored in the NRS node may contain multiple
<       locations of the content.  Assigning validity time or a lifetime
<       of each mapping record may be considered especially for the off-
<       path caching content and managing mobility.
< 
<    Name resolution:  Name resolution is performed by an NRS client to
<       obtain the name record from an NRS node by sending a name
<       resolution request message and getting a response containing the
<       record.  In the name-based ICN routing context, the name
<       resolution is needed by any ICN router whose forwarding
<       information base (FIB) does not contain the requested name prefix.
<       Name resolution may also be performed by the consumer (especially
<       in the case where the consumer is multihomed) to forward the
<       content request in a better direction so that it obtains the
<       content from the nearest cache.  If the consumer is single homed,
<       it may not bother to perform name resolution, instead depending on
<       either straightforward name-based routing or name resolution by an
<       upstream ICN router.  In this case, the consumer creates the
<       content request packet containing the content name and forwards to
<       the nearest ICN router.  The ICN router checks its FIB table to
<       see where to forward the content request.  If the ICN router fails
<       to identify whether the requested content is reachable, it
<       performs name resolution to obtain the name mapping record and
<       adds this information to its FIB.  The ICN router may also perform
<       name resolution even before the arrival of a content request to
<       use the name mapping record to configure its FIB.
< 
<    Name record update:  Name record update is carried out when a content
<       name mapping record changes, e.g., the content is not available in
<       one or more of the previous locations.  The name record update
<       includes the substitution and deletion of the name mapping
<       records.  The name record update may take place explicitly by the
<       exchange of name record update messages or implicitly when a
<       timeout occurs and a name record is deemed to be invalid.  The
<       implicit update is possible when each record is accompanied by a
<       lifetime value.  The lifetime can be renewed only by the
<       authoritative producer or node.  The cached mapping records get
<       erased after the lifetime expires unless a lifetime extension
<       indication is obtained from the authoritative producer.

<    Namespace security:  In order to deploy an NRS system in ICN
<       architecture, ICN namespaces, which may be assigned by
<       authoritative entities, must be securely mapped to the content
<       publishers and securely managed by them.  According to the ICN
<       research challenges [RFC7927], a new namespace can also provide an
<       integrity verification function to authenticate its publisher.
<       The issues of namespace authentication and the mapping among
<       different namespaces require further investigation.
< 
<    NRS system security:  An NRS requires the deployment of new entities
<       (e.g., NRS servers) to build distributed and scalable NRS systems.
<       Thus, the entities, e.g., an NRS server maintaining a mapping
<       database, could be the focus of attacks by receiving malicious
<       requests from innumerable adversaries comprising of Denial-of-
<       Service or Distributed-Denial-of-Service attacks.  In addition,
<       NRS clients in general must trust the NRS nodes in other network
<       domains to some degree, and communication among them must also be
<       protected securely to prevent malicious entities from
<       participating in this communication.  The history of name
<       resolution data requires to be stored and analyzed as in passive
<       DNS to uncover potential security incidents or discover malicious
<       infrastructures.
< 
<    NRS protocol and message security:  In an NRS system, the protocols
<       to generate, transmit, and receive NRS messages related to the
<       name registration, resolution, and record update should be
<       protected by proper security mechanisms.  Proper security measures
<       must be provided so that only legitimate nodes can initiate and
<       read NRS messages.  These messages must be secured by integrity
<       protection and authentication mechanisms so that unauthorized
<       parties cannot manipulate them when being forwarded through the
<       network.  Security measures to encrypt these messages should also
<       be developed to thwart all threats to both security and privacy.
<       Numerous problems similar to the security issues of an IP network
<       and DNS can affect the overall ICN architecture.  The DNS QNAME
<       minimization type of approach would be suitable for preserving
<       privacy in the name resolution process.  Therefore, security
<       mechanisms such as accessibility, authentication, etc., for the
<       NRS system [RFC9138] should be considered to protect not only the
<       NRS system but also the ICN architecture overall.

>    NRS system security:
>       An NRS requires the deployment of new entities (e.g., NRS servers)
>       to build distributed and scalable NRS systems.  Thus, the
>       entities, e.g., an NRS server maintaining a mapping database,
>       could be the focus of attacks by receiving malicious requests from
>       innumerable adversaries comprising of Denial-of-Service or
>       Distributed-Denial-of-Service attacks.  In addition, NRS clients
>       in general must trust the NRS nodes in other network domains to
>       some degree, and communication among them must also be protected
>       securely to prevent malicious entities from participating in this
>       communication.  The history of name resolution data requires to be
>       stored and analyzed as in passive DNS to uncover potential
>       security incidents or discover malicious infrastructures.

>    NRS protocol and message security:
>       In an NRS system, the protocols to generate, transmit, and receive
>       NRS messages related to the name registration, resolution, and
>       record update should be protected by proper security mechanisms.
>       Proper security measures must be provided so that only legitimate
>       nodes can initiate and read NRS messages.  These messages must be
>       secured by integrity protection and authentication mechanisms so
>       that unauthorized parties cannot manipulate them when being
>       forwarded through the network.  Security measures to encrypt these
>       messages should also be developed to thwart all threats to both
>       security and privacy.  Numerous problems similar to the security
>       issues of an IP network and DNS can affect the overall ICN
>       architecture.  The DNS QNAME minimization type of approach would
>       be suitable for preserving privacy in the name resolution process.
>       Therefore, security mechanisms such as accessibility,
>       authentication, etc., for the NRS system [RFC9138] should be
>       considered to protect not only the NRS system but also the ICN
>       architecture overall.
