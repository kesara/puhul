<    Acknowledged PL:  A PL that includes a mechanism that can confirm
<       successful delivery of datagrams to the remote PL endpoint (e.g.,
<       SCTP).  Typically, the PL receiver returns acknowledgments
<       corresponding to the received datagrams, which can be utilized to
<       detect black-holing of packets (c.f., Unacknowledged PL).
< 
<    Actual PMTU:  The actual PMTU is the PMTU of a network path between a
