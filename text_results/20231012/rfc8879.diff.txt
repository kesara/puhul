<    uncompressed_length:  The length of the Certificate message once it
<       is uncompressed.  If, after decompression, the specified length
<       does not match the actual length, the party receiving the invalid
<       message MUST abort the connection with the "bad_certificate"
<       alert.  The presence of this field allows the receiver to
<       preallocate the buffer for the uncompressed Certificate message
<       and enforce limits on the message size before performing
<       decompression.
< 
<    compressed_certificate_message:  The result of applying the indicated
<       compression algorithm to the encoded Certificate message that
<       would have been sent if certificate compression was not in use.
<       The compression algorithm defines how the bytes in the
<       compressed_certificate_message field are converted into the
<       Certificate message.
