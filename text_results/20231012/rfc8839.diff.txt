<    Default Destination/Candidate:  The default destination for a
<       component of a data stream is the transport address that would be
<       used by an agent that is not ICE aware.  A default candidate for a
<       component is one whose transport address matches the default
<       destination for that component.  For the RTP component, the
<       default connection address is in the "c=" line of the SDP, and the
<       port and transport protocol are in the "m=" line.  For the RTP
<       Control Protocol (RTCP) component, the address and port are
<       indicated using the "rtcp" attribute defined in [RFC3605], if
<       present; otherwise, the RTCP component address is the same as the
<       address of the RTP component, and its port is one greater than the
<       port of the RTP component.

<    <foundation>:  is composed of 1 to 32 <ice-char>s.  It is an
<       identifier that is equivalent for two candidates that are of the
<       same type, share the same base, and come from the same STUN
<       server.  The foundation is used to optimize ICE performance in the
<       Frozen algorithm as described in [RFC8445].
< 
<    <component-id>:  is a positive integer between 1 and 256 (inclusive)
<       that identifies the specific component of the data stream for
<       which this is a candidate.  It MUST start at 1 and MUST increment
<       by 1 for each component of a particular candidate.  For data
<       streams based on RTP, candidates for the actual RTP media MUST
<       have a component ID of 1, and candidates for RTCP MUST have a
<       component ID of 2.  See Section 13 of [RFC8445] for additional
<       discussion on extending ICE to new data streams.
< 
<    <priority>:  is a positive integer between 1 and (2**31 - 1)
<       inclusive.  The procedures for computing a candidate's priority
<       are described in Section 5.1.2 of [RFC8445].
< 
<    <cand-type>:  encodes the type of candidate.  This specification
<       defines the values "host", "srflx", "prflx", and "relay" for host,
<       server-reflexive, peer-reflexive, and relayed candidates,
<       respectively.  Specifications for new candidate types MUST define
<       how, if at all, various steps in the ICE processing differ from
<       the ones defined by this specification.
< 
<    <rel-addr> and <rel-port>:  convey transport addresses related to the
<       candidate, useful for diagnostics and other purposes. <rel-addr>
<       and <rel-port> MUST be present for server-reflexive, peer-
<       reflexive, and relayed candidates.  If a candidate is server-
<       reflexive or peer-reflexive, <rel-addr> and <rel-port> are equal
<       to the base for that server-reflexive or peer-reflexive candidate.
<       If the candidate is relayed, <rel-addr> and <rel-port> are equal
<       to the mapped address in the Allocate response that provided the
<       client with that relayed candidate (see Section 6.3 of [RFC5766]).
