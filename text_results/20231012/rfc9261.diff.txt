<    multiple identities:  Endpoints that are authoritative for multiple
<       identities, but that do not have a single certificate that

<    certificate_request_context:  An opaque string that identifies the
<       authenticator request and that will be echoed in the authenticator
<       message.  A certificate_request_context value MUST be unique for
<       each authenticator request within the scope of a connection
<       (preventing replay and context confusion).  The
<       certificate_request_context SHOULD be chosen to be unpredictable
<       to the peer (e.g., by randomly generating it) in order to prevent
<       an attacker who has temporary access to the peer's private key
<       from precomputing valid authenticators.  For example, the
<       application may choose this value to correspond to a value used in
<       an existing data structure in the software to simplify
<       implementation.
