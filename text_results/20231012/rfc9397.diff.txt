<    Device User:  A human being that uses a device.  Many devices have a
<       single device user.  Some devices have a primary device user with
<       other human beings as secondary device users (e.g., a parent
<       allowing children to use their tablet or laptop).  Other devices
<       are not used by a human being; hence, they have no device user.
< 
<    Personalization Data:  A set of configuration data that is specific
<       to the device or user.  The Personalization Data may depend on the
<       type of TEE, a particular TEE instance, the TA, and even the user
<       of the device.  An example of Personalization Data might be a
<       secret symmetric key used by a TA to communicate with some
<       service.
< 
<    Raw Public Key:  A raw public key consists of only the algorithm
<       identifier (type) of the key and the cryptographic public key
<       material, such as the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure of a PKIX
<       certificate [RFC5280].  Other serialization formats that do not

<       and governed by a typical OS (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, iOS),
<       potentially in conjunction with other supporting operating systems
<       and hypervisors; it is outside of the TEE(s) managed by the TEEP

<    Trusted Application (TA):  An application (or, in some

<       Personalization Data are thus managed by being included in Trusted

<    Trusted Component Signer:  An entity that signs a Trusted Component
<       with a key that a TEE will trust.  The signer might or might not
<       be the same entity as the Trusted Component Developer.  For
<       example, a Trusted Component might be signed (or re-signed) by a
<       Device Administrator if the TEE will only trust the Device
<       Administrator.  A Trusted Component might also be encrypted if the
<       code is considered confidential, for example, when a developer
<       wants to provide a TA without revealing its code to others.
< 
<    Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):  An execution environment that
<       enforces that only authorized code can execute within the TEE and
<       data used by that code cannot be read or tampered with by code
<       outside the TEE.  A TEE also generally has a unique device
<       credential that cannot be cloned.  There are multiple technologies
<       that can be used to implement a TEE, and the level of security
<       achieved varies accordingly.  In addition, TEEs typically use an
<       isolation mechanism between Trusted Applications to ensure that
<       one TA cannot read, modify, or delete the data and code of another
<       TA.
< 
<    Untrusted Application (UA):  An application running in an REE.  An

<    Trusted Component Signer and Device Administrator:  Trusted Component

<    TEEP Agent:  The TEEP Agent is a processing module running inside a

<       Broker that runs in an REE).  A TEEP Agent in the TEE may parse or
<       forward requests to other processing modules in a TEE, which is up
<       to a TEE provider's implementation.  A response message
<       corresponding to a TAM request is sent back to the TAM, again
<       typically relayed via a TEEP Broker.

<    Certification Authority (CA):  A CA is an entity that issues digital
<       certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the

<       Certificates are then used for authenticating a device, a TAM, or
<       a Trusted Component Signer, as discussed in Section 5.  The CAs do
<       not need to be the same; different CAs can be chosen by each TAM,
