<       R (Removal - 1 bit):  When set, the requesting PCEP peer requires
<          the removal of an LSP from the association group.  When unset,

<          part of the association group.  This flag is used for the

<    Association ID (2 bytes):  The identifier of the association group.
<       When combined with other association parameters, such as an
<       Association Type and Association Source, this value uniquely
<       identifies an association group.  The values 0xffff and 0x0 are
<       reserved.  The value 0xffff is used to indicate all association
<       groups and could be used with the R flag to indicate removal for
<       all associations for the LSP within the scope of the Association
<       Type and Association Source.
< 
<    Association Source:  Contains a valid IPv4 address (4 bytes) if the
<       ASSOCIATION Object-Type is 1 or a valid IPv6 address (16 bytes) if
<       the ASSOCIATION Object-Type is 2.  The address provides scoping
<       for the Association ID.  See Section 6.1.3 for details.
