<       Address Prefix:  For the address family IPv4 unicast, the
<             prefix itself is encoded as a 32-bit value.  The default
<             route is represented by a prefix of length 0.
< 
<             For the address family IPv6 unicast, the
<             prefix is encoded as an even multiple of 32-bit words and
<             padded with zeroed bits as necessary.  This encoding
<             consumes ((PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words.
< 
<             Prefix encoding for other address families is
<             beyond the scope of this specification.  Prefix encoding for
<             other address families can be defined in future Standards
<             Track specifications from the IETF stream.
