<    Less ticket waste:  Currently, TLS servers use application-specific,
<       and often implementation-specific, logic to determine how many
<       tickets to issue.  By moving the burden of ticket count to
<       clients, servers do not generate wasteful tickets.  As an example,
<       clients might only request one ticket during resumption.
<       Moreover, as ticket generation might involve expensive
<       computation, e.g., public key cryptographic operations, avoiding
<       waste is desirable.
< 
<    Decline resumption:  Clients can indicate they do not intend to
<       resume a connection by sending a ticket request with count of
<       zero.
