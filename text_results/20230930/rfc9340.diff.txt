<    "At source":  In this scheme, one of the two nodes sends a flying
<       qubit that is entangled with one of its matter qubits.  A
<       transducer at the other end of the link will transfer the
<       entanglement from the flying qubit to one of its matter qubits.
<       Just like in the previous scheme, the transducer knows if its
<       transfer succeeded and is able to herald successful entanglement
<       generation with a classical message sent to the other node.
< 
<    "At both end-points":  In this scheme, both nodes send a flying qubit
<       that is entangled with one of their matter qubits.  A detector
<       somewhere in between the nodes performs a joint measurement on the
<       flying qubits, which stochastically projects the remote matter
<       qubits into an entangled quantum state.  The detector knows if the
<       entanglement succeeded and is able to herald successful
<       entanglement generation by sending a message to each node over the
