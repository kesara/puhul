<    Performance Metric:  A quantitative measure of performance, targeted
<       to an IETF-specified protocol or targeted to an application
<       transported over an IETF-specified protocol.  Examples of
<       Performance Metrics are the FTP response time for a complete file
<       download, the DNS Response time to resolve the IP address(es), a
<       database logging time, etc.  This definition is consistent with
<       the definition of a metric in [RFC2330] and broader than the
<       definition of a Performance Metric in [RFC6390].
< 
<    Registered Performance Metric:  A Performance Metric expressed as an
<       entry in the Performance Metrics Registry, administered by IANA.
<       Such a Performance Metric has met all of the Registry review
<       criteria defined in this document in order to be included in the
<       Registry.
< 
<    Performance Metrics Registry:  The IANA Registry containing
<       Registered Performance Metrics.
< 
<    Proprietary Registry:  A set of metrics that are registered in a

<    Parameter:  An input factor defined as a variable in the definition
<       of a Performance Metric.  A Parameter is a numerical or other
<       specified factor forming one of a set that defines a metric or
<       sets the conditions of its operation.  All Parameters must be
<       known in order to make a measurement using a metric and interpret
<       the results.  There are two types of Parameters: Fixed and
<       Runtime.  For the Fixed Parameters, the value of the variable is
<       specified in the Performance Metrics Registry Entry and different
<       Fixed Parameter values results in different Registered Performance

<    Active Measurement Methods:  Methods of Measurement conducted on
<       traffic that serves only the purpose of measurement and is
<       generated for that reason alone, and whose traffic characteristics
<       are known a priori.  The complete definition of Active Methods is
<       specified in Section 3.4 of [RFC7799].  Examples of Active
<       Measurement Methods are the Measurement Methods for the one-way
<       delay metric defined in [RFC7679] and the round-trip delay metric
<       defined in [RFC2681].
< 
<    Passive Measurement Methods:  Methods of Measurement conducted on
<       network traffic, generated by either (1) the end users or
<       (2) network elements that would exist regardless of whether the
<       measurement was being conducted or not.  The complete definition
<       of Passive Methods is specified in Section 3.6 of [RFC7799].  One
<       characteristic of Passive Measurement Methods is that sensitive
<       information may be observed and, as a consequence, stored in the
<       measurement system.
< 
<    Hybrid Measurement Methods:  Methods of Measurement that use a
<       combination of Active Methods and Passive Methods, to assess
<       Active Metrics, Passive Metrics, or new metrics derived from the
<       a priori knowledge and observations of the stream of interest.

<    Control Protocol:  This type of protocol is used to allow one entity
<       to request that another entity perform a measurement using a

<       particular example is the Large-scale Measurement of Broadband

<       Control Protocol to allow a Controller to schedule a Measurement
<       Task for one or more Measurement Agents.  In order to enable this
