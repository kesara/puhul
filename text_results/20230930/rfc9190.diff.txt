<    [1] Mutual authentication:  By mandating revocation checking of
<        certificates, the authentication in EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 is
<        stronger as authentication with revoked certificates will always
<        fail.
< 
<    [2] Confidentiality:  The TLS 1.3 handshake offers much better
<        confidentiality than earlier versions of TLS.  EAP-TLS with TLS
<        1.3 mandates use of cipher suites that ensure confidentiality.
<        TLS 1.3 also encrypts certificates and some of the extensions.
<        When using EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3, the use of privacy is mandatory
<        and does not cause any additional round trips.
< 
<    [3] Cryptographic strength:  TLS 1.3 only defines strong algorithms
<        without major weaknesses and EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 always provides
<        forward secrecy; see [RFC8446].  Weak algorithms such as 3DES,
<        CBC mode, RC4, SHA-1, MD5, P-192, and RSA-1024 have not been
<        registered for use in TLS 1.3.
< 
<    [4] Cryptographic negotiation:  The TLS layer handles the negotiation
<        of cryptographic parameters.  When EAP-TLS is used with TLS 1.3,
<        EAP-TLS inherits the cryptographic negotiation of the AEAD
<        algorithm, HKDF hash algorithm, key exchange groups, and
<        signature algorithm; see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC8446].
