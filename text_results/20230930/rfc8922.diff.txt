<    Transport Feature:  a specific end-to-end feature that the transport
<       layer provides to an application.  Examples include
<       confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, and message-
<       versus-stream orientation.
< 
<    Transport Service:  a set of Transport Features, without an
<       association to any given framing protocol, that provides
<       functionality to an application.
< 
<    Transport Services system:  a software component that exposes an
<       interface to different Transport Services to an application.
< 
<    Transport Protocol:  an implementation that provides one or more
<       different Transport Services using a specific framing and header
<       format on the wire.  A Transport Protocol services an application,
<       whether directly or in conjunction with a security protocol.
< 
<    Application:  an entity that uses a transport protocol for end-to-end
<       delivery of data across the network.  This may also be an upper
<       layer protocol or tunnel encapsulation.
< 
<    Security Protocol:  a defined network protocol that implements one or
<       more security features, such as authentication, encryption, key
<       generation, session resumption, and privacy.  Security protocols
<       may be used alongside transport protocols, and in combination with
<       other security protocols when appropriate.
< 
<    Handshake Protocol:  a protocol that enables peers to validate each
<       other and to securely establish shared cryptographic context.
