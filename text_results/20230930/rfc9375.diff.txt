<    PM statistics per class:  "one-way-pm-statistics-per-class" lists
<       performance measurement statistics for the topology link or the

<       used to collect generic metrics for unspecified "class-id" names.
< 
<    VPN PM type ("vpn-pm-type"):  Indicates the VPN performance type,
<       which can be "inter-vpn-access-interface" PM or "vpn-tunnel" PM.
<       These two methods are common VPN measurement methods.  The "inter-
<       VPN-access-interface" PM is used to monitor the performance of
<       logical point-to-point VPN connections between source and
<       destination VPN access interfaces.  And the "vpn-tunnel" PM is
<       used to monitor the performance of VPN tunnels.  The "inter-VPN-
<       access-interface" PM includes PE-PE monitoring.  Therefore,
<       usually only one of the two methods is used.  The "inter-VPN-
<       access-interface" PM is defined as an empty leaf, which is not
<       bound to a specific VPN access interface.  The source or
<       destination VPN access interface of the measurement can be
<       augmented as needed.
< 
<    VPN tunnel type ("vpn-tunnel-type"):  Indicates the abstract link
<       protocol-type of a VPN, such as GRE or IP-in-IP.  The leaf refers
<       to an identifier of the "underlay-transport" defined in [RFC9181],
<       which describes the transport technology that carries the traffic
<       of the VPN service.  In the case of multiple types of tunnels
<       between a single pair of VPN nodes, a separate link for each type
<       of tunnel can be created.
