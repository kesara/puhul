<    Fully automated mode:  This mode does not require any action from the
<       administrator when receiving a request for a service.  The server
<       can execute its decision-making process related to the orders
<       received and can generate corresponding offers.
< 
<    Administrative validation checking:  Some or all of the server's
<       operations are subject to administrative validation procedures.
<       This mode requires an action from the administrator for every
<       request received.  To that aim, the CPNP methods that can be
<       automatically handled by the server (or are subject to one or
<       several validation administrative checks) can be configured on the

<    Setup purpose:  A client may request the setup of a service (e.g.,
