< 
<    Outstanding Data (or Data Outstanding or Data In Flight):  The total

<       has not yet received an acknowledgement.
< 
<    "Out of the Blue" (OOTB) Packet:  A correctly formed packet, for
<       which the receiver cannot identify the association it belongs to.
<       See Section 8.4.
< 
<    Path:  The route taken by the SCTP packets sent by one SCTP endpoint
<       to a specific destination transport address of its peer SCTP
<       endpoint.  Sending to different destination transport addresses
<       does not necessarily guarantee getting separate paths.  Within
<       this specification, a path is identified by the destination
<       transport address, since the routing is assumed to be stable.
<       This includes, in particular, the source address being selected
<       when sending packets to the destination address.
< 
<    Path Maximum DATA Chunk Size (PMDCS):  The maximum size (including
<       the DATA chunk header) of a DATA chunk that fits into an SCTP
<       packet not exceeding the PMTU of a particular destination address.
< 
<    Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU):  The maximum size (including
<       the SCTP common header and all chunks including their paddings) of
<       an SCTP packet that can be sent to a particular destination
<       address without using IP-level fragmentation.
< 
<    Primary Path:  The destination and source address that will be put
<       into a packet outbound to the peer endpoint by default.  The
<       definition includes the source address since an implementation MAY
<       wish to specify both destination and source address to better
<       control the return path taken by reply chunks and on which
<       interface the packet is transmitted when the data sender is multi-
<       homed.
< 
<    Receiver Window (rwnd):  An SCTP variable a data sender uses to store
<       the most recently calculated receiver window of its peer, in
<       number of bytes.  This gives the sender an indication of the space
<       available in the receiver's inbound buffer.
< 
<    SCTP Association:  A protocol relationship between SCTP endpoints,
<       composed of the two SCTP endpoints and protocol state information,
<       including Verification Tags and the currently active set of
<       Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs), etc.  An association can be
<       uniquely identified by the transport addresses used by the
<       endpoints in the association.  Two SCTP endpoints MUST NOT have
<       more than one SCTP association between them at any given time.

<    Stream Sequence Number:  A 16-bit sequence number used internally by
<       SCTP to ensure sequenced delivery of the user messages within a
<       given stream.  One Stream Sequence Number is attached to each
<       ordered user message.
< 
<    Tie-Tags:  Two 32-bit random numbers that together make a 64-bit
<       nonce.  These tags are used within a State Cookie and TCB so that
<       a newly restarting association can be linked to the original
<       association within the endpoint that did not restart and yet not
<       reveal the true Verification Tags of an existing association.
< 
<    Transmission Control Block (TCB):  An internal data structure created
<       by an SCTP endpoint for each of its existing SCTP associations to
<       other SCTP endpoints.  TCB contains all the status and operational
<       information for the endpoint to maintain and manage the
<       corresponding association.
< 
<    Transmission Sequence Number (TSN):  A 32-bit sequence number used
<       internally by SCTP.  One TSN is attached to each chunk containing
<       user data to permit the receiving SCTP endpoint to acknowledge its
<       receipt and detect duplicate deliveries.
< 
<    Transport Address:  A transport address is typically defined by a
<       network-layer address, a transport-layer protocol, and a
<       transport-layer port number.  In the case of SCTP running over IP,
<       a transport address is defined by the combination of an IP address
<       and an SCTP port number (where SCTP is the transport protocol).
< 
<    Unordered Message:  Unordered messages are "unordered" with respect
<       to any other message; this includes both other unordered messages
<       as well as other ordered messages.  An unordered message might be
<       delivered prior to or later than ordered messages sent on the same
<       stream.
< 
<    User Message:  The unit of data delivery across the interface between
<       SCTP and its user.
< 
<    Verification Tag:  A 32-bit unsigned integer that is randomly
<       generated.  The Verification Tag provides a key that allows a
<       receiver to verify that the SCTP packet belongs to the current
<       association and is not an old or stale packet from a previous
<       association.
