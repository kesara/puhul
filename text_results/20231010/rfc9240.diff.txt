<    Entity Identifier Encoding:  The procedure for encoding the
<       identifier of an entity of the registered domain type as an
<       EntityID (see Section 5.1.3).  If corresponding entity identifiers
<       of an entity domain type match a known "network" address type, the
<       Entity Identifier Encoding of this domain identifier MUST include
<       both Address Encoding and Prefix Encoding of the same identifier
<       registered in the "ALTO Address Types" registry [RFC7285].  To
<       define properties, an individual entity identifier and the

<       the same entity.

<    Hierarchy:  If the entities form a hierarchy, the procedure for

<    Media type of defining information resource:  Some entity domain
