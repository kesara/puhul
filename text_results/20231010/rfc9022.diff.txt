<    <rdeCsv:fields>  Ordered list of CSV fields used in the CSV files.
<       There are one or more child elements that substitute for the
<       <rdeCsv:field> abstract element.  Each element defines the format
<       of the CSV field contained in the CSV files.  The <rdeCsv:field>
<       elements support the "type" attribute that defines the XML simple
<       data type of the field element.  The <rdeCsv:field> elements
<       support the "isRequired" attribute, which has a default value of
<       "false".  When set to "true", this indicates that the field must
<       be non-empty in the CSV files, and when set to "false", this
<       indicates that the field MAY be empty in the CSV files.  The
<       "isRequired" attribute MAY be specifically set for the field
<       elements within the XML schema and MAY be overridden when
<       specifying the fields under the <rdeCsv:fields> element.  The
<       <rdeCsv:field> element supports an OPTIONAL "parent" attribute
<       that identifies the field as a reference to a parent object, as
<       defined in the 'CSV Parent Child Relationship' (Section 4.6.1).
<       For example, the <rdeCsv:csv name="domainStatuses">
<       <csvDomain:fName> field SHOULD set the "parent" attribute to
