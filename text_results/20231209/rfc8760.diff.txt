<    6.  [RFC7616] requires that a server check that the URI in the
<        request line and the URI included in the Authorization header
<        field point to the same resource.  In a SIP context, these two
<        URIs may refer to different users due to forwarding at some
<        proxy.  Therefore, in SIP, a UAS MUST check if the Request-URI in
<        the Authorization/Proxy-Authorization header field value
<        corresponds to a user for whom the UAS is willing to accept
<        forwarded or direct requests; however, it MAY still accept it if
<        the two fields are not equivalent.
