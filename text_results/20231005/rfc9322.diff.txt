<    Bit 2 "Active" (A-bit):  When set, the Active flag indicates that a
<       packet is an active measurement packet rather than a data packet,
<       where "active" is used in the sense defined in [RFC7799].  The
<       packet may be an IOAM probe packet or a replicated data packet
<       (the second and third use cases of Section 5).
