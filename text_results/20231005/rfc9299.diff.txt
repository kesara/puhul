<       be set by ETRs to specify which RLOCs of the ETR site are up/down.
<       This information can be used by the ITRs as a hint about the
<       reachability to perform additional checks.  Also note that LSBs do
<       not provide path reachability status; they only provide hints
<       about the status of RLOCs.  As such, they must not be used over
<       the public Internet and should be coupled with Map-Versioning to
<       prevent race conditions where LSBs are interpreted as referring to
<       different RLOCs than intended.
< 
<    Echo-Nonce:  This is also a passive technique that can only operate
<       effectively when data flows bidirectionally between two
<       communicating xTRs.  Basically, an ITR piggybacks a random number
<       (called a nonce) in LISP data packets.  If the path and the probed
<       Locator are up, the ETR will piggyback the same random number on
<       the next data packet; if this is not the case, the ITR can set the
<       Locator as unreachable.  When traffic flow is unidirectional or
<       when the ETR receiving the traffic is not the same as the ITR that
<       transmits it back, additional mechanisms are required.  The Echo-

<    RLOC-Probing:  This is an active probing algorithm where ITRs send

<       Map-Request (with certain flags activated) on the data plane (RLOC
<       space) and then waiting for a Map-Reply (also sent on the data
