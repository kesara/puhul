<    Edge Computing Device (ECD):  This is a computing device (or server)
<       at the edge of the network for vehicles and vulnerable road users.
<       It co-locates with or connects to an IP Roadside Unit (IP-RSU),
<       which has a powerful computing capability for different kinds of

< 
<    Edge Network (EN):  This is an access network that has an IP-RSU for
<       wireless communication with other vehicles having an IP On-Board
<       Unit (IP-OBU) and wired communication with other network devices
<       (e.g., routers, IP-RSUs, ECDs, servers, and Mobility Anchors
<       (MAs)).  It may use a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
<       such as Global Positioning System (GPS) with a GNSS receiver for
<       its position recognition and the localization service for the sake

<    Evolved Node B (eNodeB):  This is a base station entity that supports

< 
<    Internet Protocol On-Board Unit (IP-OBU):  An IP-OBU denotes a
<       computer situated in a vehicle (e.g., car, bicycle, electric bike,
<       motorcycle, or similar), which has a basic processing ability and
<       can be driven by a low-power CPU (e.g., ARM).  It has at least one
<       IP interface that runs in IEEE 802.11-OCB and has an "OBU"
<       transceiver.  Also, it may have an IP interface that runs in
<       Cellular V2X (C-V2X) [TS-23.285-3GPP] [TR-22.886-3GPP]
<       [TS-23.287-3GPP].  It can play the role of a router connecting
<       multiple computers (or in-vehicle devices) inside a vehicle.  See
<       the definition of the term "IP-OBU" in [RFC8691].
< 
<    IP Roadside Unit (IP-RSU):  An IP-RSU is situated along the road.  It
<       has at least two distinct IP-enabled interfaces.  The wireless
<       PHY/MAC layer of at least one of its IP-enabled interfaces is
<       configured to operate in 802.11-OCB mode [IEEE-802.11-OCB].  An
<       IP-RSU communicates with the IP-OBU over an 802.11 wireless link
<       operating in OCB mode.  One of its IP-enabled interfaces is
<       connected to the wired network for wired communication with other
<       network devices (e.g., routers, IP-RSUs, ECDs, servers, and MAs).
<       Also, it may have another IP-enabled wireless interface running in
<       3GPP C-V2X in addition to the IP-RSU defined in [RFC8691].  An IP-
<       RSU is similar to an Access Network Router (ANR), defined in

< 
<    Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR):  This is a method for measuring
<       a distance to an object by emitting pulsed laser light and
<       measuring the reflected pulsed light.
< 
<    Mobility Anchor (MA):  This is a node that maintains IPv6 addresses
<       and mobility information of vehicles in a road network to support
<       their IPv6 address autoconfiguration and mobility management with
