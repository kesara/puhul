<    Path Computation:  When computing a path for an LSP, it is useful to
<       analyze the impact of this LSP on the other LSPs belonging to the
<       same VN.  The aim would be to optimize all LSPs belonging to the
<       VN rather than a single LSP.  Also, the optimization criteria
<       (such as minimizing the load of the most loaded link (MLL)
<       [RFC5541]) could be applied for all the LSPs belonging to the VN
<       identified by the VN association.
< 
<    Path Reoptimization:  The PCE would like to use advanced path
<       computation algorithms and optimization techniques that consider
<       all the LSPs belonging to a VN and optimize them all together
<       during the path reoptimization.
