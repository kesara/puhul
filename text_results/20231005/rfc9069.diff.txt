<    Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-Out:  The result before applying the outbound
<       policy to an Adj-RIB-Out. This normally represents a similar view
<       of the Loc-RIB but may contain additional routes based on BGP
<       peering configuration.
< 
<    Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out:  The result of applying the outbound policy
<       to an Adj-RIB-Out. This MUST be what is actually sent to the peer.

<    Sent OPEN Message:  This is a fabricated BGP OPEN message.
<       Capabilities MUST include the 4-octet ASN and all necessary
<       capabilities to represent the Loc-RIB Route Monitoring messages.
<       Only include capabilities if they will be used for Loc-RIB
<       monitoring messages.  For example, if ADD-PATH is enabled for IPv6
<       and Loc-RIB contains additional paths, the ADD-PATH capability
<       should be included for IPv6.  In the case of ADD-PATH, the
<       capability intent of advertise, receive, or both can be ignored
<       since the presence of the capability indicates enough that
<       additional paths will be used for IPv6.
< 
<    Received OPEN Message:  Repeat of the same sent OPEN message.  The
<       duplication allows the BMP receiver to parse the expected received
<       OPEN message as defined in Section 4.10 of [RFC7854].
