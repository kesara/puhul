<    SENDER MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE (SMSS):  The size of the largest segment
<       that the sender can transmit.  This value can be based on the
<       maximum transmission unit of the network, the Path MTU Discovery
<       algorithm [RFC1191] [RFC4821], RMSS (see next item), or other
<       factors.  The size does not include the TCP/IP headers and
<       options.
