<    Name:  The JSON name requested (e.g., "ms").  Because a core goal of

<       sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a case-
<       insensitive manner unless the designated experts determine that
<       there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.  The name is
<       not used in the CBOR encoding.

<    CBOR Label:  The value to be used to identify this name.  Map key

<       negative integer, or a string.  Integer values between -256 and
<       255 and strings of length 1 are designated as Standards Track
<       document required.  Integer values from -65536 to -257 and from
