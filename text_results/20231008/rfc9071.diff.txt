<    BS (U+0008):  "Back Space".  Intended to erase the last entered
<       character by a source.  Erasure by backspace cannot always be
<       performed as the erasing party intended.  If an erasing action
<       erases all text up to the end of the leading label after a source
<       switch, then the mixer MUST NOT transmit more backspaces.
<       Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that a letter "X" be inserted in the
<       text stream for each backspace as an indication of the intent to
<       erase more.  A new line is usually coded by a Line Separator, but
<       the character combination "CRLF" MAY be used instead.  Erasure of
<       a new line is, in both cases, done by just one erasing action
<       (backspace).  If the display count has a positive value, it SHALL
<       be decreased by one when the BS is sent.  If the display count is
<       at zero, it SHALL NOT be altered.
