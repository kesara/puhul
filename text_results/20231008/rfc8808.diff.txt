<    Management operations:  The contents of the datastore is set by the
<       server in an implementation-dependent manner.  The contents cannot
<       be changed by management operations via the Network Configuration
<       Protocol (NETCONF), RESTCONF, the CLI, etc., unless specialized,
<       dedicated operations are provided.  The datastore can be read
<       using the standard NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol operations.  The
<       "factory-reset" operation copies the factory default contents to
<       <running> and, if present, <startup> and/or <candidate>.  The
<       contents of these datastores is then propagated automatically to
