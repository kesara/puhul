<    Blocking of messages:  Offer/Answer is defined as a strictly
<       sequential mechanism in [RFC3264].  There can only be a maximum of
<       one active exchange at any point of time.  Both sides cannot
<       simultaneously send Offers nor can they generate multiple Offers
<       prior to receiving an Answer.  Using UPDATE requests for candidate
<       transport would therefore imply the implementation of a candidate
<       pool at every agent where candidates can be stored until it is
<       once again that agent's "turn" to emit an Answer or a new Offer.
<       Such an approach would introduce non-negligible complexity for no
<       additional value.
< 
<    Elevated risk of glare:  The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also
<       makes it impossible for both sides to send Offers simultaneously.
<       What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to actually
<       prevent that.  [RFC3261], where the situation of Offers crossing
<       on the wire is described as "glare", only defines a procedure for
<       addressing the issue after it has occurred.  According to that
<       procedure, both Offers are invalidated and both sides need to
<       retry the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.  The
<       high likelihood for glare and the average two-second backoff
<       intervals to occur implies that the duration of Trickle ICE
<       processing would not only fail to improve but actually exceed
<       those of regular ICE.
