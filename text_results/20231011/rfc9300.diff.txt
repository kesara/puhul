<    Address Family Identifier (AFI):  "AFI" is a term used to describe an
<       address encoding in a packet.  An address family is an address
<       format found in data plane packet headers, for example, an IPv4
<       address or an IPv6 address.  See [AFN], [RFC2453], [RFC2677], and
<       [RFC4760] for details.  An AFI value of 0 used in this
<       specification indicates an unspecified encoded address where the
<       length of the address is 0 octets following the 16-bit AFI value
<       of 0.
< 
<    Anycast Address:  "Anycast address" refers to the same IPv4 or IPv6
<       address configured and used on multiple systems at the same time.
<       An EID or RLOC can be an anycast address in each of their own
<       address spaces.
< 
<    Client-side:  "Client-side" is a term used in this document to
<       indicate a connection initiation attempt by an end-system
<       represented by an EID.
< 
<    Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):  An ETR is a router that accepts an IP
<       packet where the destination address in the "outer" IP header is
<       one of its own RLOCs.  The router strips the "outer" header and
<       forwards the packet based on the next IP header found.  In
<       general, an ETR receives LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the
<       Internet on one side and sends decapsulated IP packets to site
<       end-systems on the other side.  ETR functionality does not have to
<       be limited to a router device.  A server host can be the endpoint
<       of a LISP tunnel as well.
< 
<    EID-to-RLOC Database:  The EID-to-RLOC Database is a distributed
<       database that contains all known EID-Prefix-to-RLOC mappings.
<       Each potential ETR typically contains a small piece of the
<       database: the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the EID-Prefixes "behind"
<       the router.  These map to one of the router's own IP addresses
<       that are routable on the underlay.  Note that there MAY be
<       transient conditions when the EID-Prefix for the LISP site and
<       Locator-Set for each EID-Prefix may not be the same on all ETRs.
<       This has no negative implications, since a partial set of Locators
<       can be used.
< 
<    EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache:  The EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache is a generally
<       short-lived, on-demand table in an Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR)
<       that stores, tracks, and is responsible for timing out and
<       otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC mappings.  This cache is distinct
<       from the full "database" of EID-to-RLOC mappings; it is dynamic,
<       local to the ITR(s), and relatively small, while the database is
<       distributed, relatively static, and much more widely scoped to
<       LISP nodes.
< 
<    EID-Prefix:  An EID-Prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs that are
<       allocated to a site by an address allocation authority.  EID-
<       Prefixes are associated with a set of RLOC addresses.  EID-Prefix
<       allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC-Set
<       is to be associated with the larger EID-Prefix block.
< 
<    End-System:  An end-system is an IPv4 or IPv6 device that originates
<       packets with a single IPv4 or IPv6 header.  The end-system
<       supplies an EID value for the destination address field of the IP
<       header when communicating outside of its routing domain.  An end-
<       system can be a host computer, a switch or router device, or any
<       network appliance.
< 
<    Endpoint ID (EID):  An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for
<       IPv6) value that identifies a host.  EIDs are generally only found
<       in the source and destination address fields of the first
<       (innermost) LISP header of a packet.  The host obtains a
<       destination EID through a Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034]
<       lookup or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] exchange.
<       This behavior does not change when LISP is in use.  The source EID
<       is obtained via existing mechanisms used to set a host's "local"
<       IP address.  An EID used on the public Internet MUST have the same
<       properties as any other IP address used in that manner; this
<       means, among other things, that it MUST be unique.  An EID is
<       allocated to a host from an EID-Prefix block associated with the
<       site where the host is located.  An EID can be used by a host to
<       refer to other hosts.  Note that EID blocks MAY be assigned in a
<       hierarchical manner, independent of the network topology, to
<       facilitate scaling of the mapping database.  In addition, an EID
<       block assigned to a site MAY have site-local structure
<       (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure is not
<       visible to the underlay routing system.  In theory, the bit string
<       that represents an EID for one device can represent an RLOC for a
<       different device.  When discussing other Locator/ID separation
<       proposals, any references to an EID in this document will refer to
<       a LISP EID.
< 
<    Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):  An ITR is a router that resides in a
<       LISP site.  Packets sent by sources inside of the LISP site to
<       destinations outside of the site are candidates for encapsulation
<       by the ITR.  The ITR treats the IP destination address as an EID
<       and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup.  The router then
<       prepends an "outer" IP header with one of its routable RLOCs (in
<       the RLOC space) in the source address field and the result of the
<       mapping lookup in the destination address field.  Note that this
<       destination RLOC may be an intermediate, proxy device that has
<       better knowledge of the EID-to-RLOC mapping closer to the
<       destination EID.  In general, an ITR receives IP packets from site
<       end-systems on one side and sends LISP-encapsulated IP packets
<       toward the Internet on the other side.
< 
<    LISP Header:  "LISP header" is a term used in this document to refer
<       to the outer IPv4 or IPv6 header, a UDP header, and a LISP-
<       specific 8-octet header, all of which follow the UDP header.  An
<       ITR prepends LISP headers on packets, and an ETR strips them.
< 
<    LISP Router:  A LISP router is a router that performs the functions
<       of any or all of the following: ITRs, ETRs, Re-encapsulating
<       Tunneling Routers (RTRs), Proxy-ITRs (PITRs), or Proxy-ETRs
<       (PETRs).
< 
<    LISP Site:  A LISP site is a set of routers in an edge network that
<       are under a single technical administration.  LISP routers that
<       reside in the edge network are the demarcation points to separate
<       the edge network from the core network.
< 
<    Locator-Status-Bits (LSBs):  Locator-Status-Bits are present in the
<       LISP header.  They are used by ITRs to inform ETRs about the up/
<       down status of all ETRs at the local site.  These bits are used as
<       a hint to convey up/down router status and not path reachability
<       status.  The LSBs can be verified by use of one of the Locator
<       reachability algorithms described in Section 10.  An ETR MUST rate
<       limit the action it takes when it detects changes in the Locator-
<       Status-Bits.

<    Recursive Tunneling:  Recursive Tunneling occurs when a packet has

<       source site.  Each RLOC in a Map-Reply is assigned an ordinal
<       value from 0 to n-1 (when there are n RLOCs in a mapping entry).
<       The Locator-Status-Bits are numbered from 0 to n-1 from the least
<       significant bit of the field.  The field is 32 bits when the I-bit
<       is set to 0 and is 8 bits when the I-bit is set to 1.  When a
<       Locator-Status-Bit is set to 1, the ITR is indicating to the ETR
<       that the RLOC associated with the bit ordinal has up status.  See
<       Section 10 for details on how an ITR can determine the status of
<       the ETRs at the same site.  When a site has multiple EID-Prefixes
<       that result in multiple mappings (where each could have a
<       different Locator-Set), the Locator-Status-Bits setting in an
<       encapsulated packet MUST reflect the mapping for the EID-Prefix
<       that the inner-header source EID address matches (longest-match).
<       If the LSB for an anycast Locator is set to 1, then there is at
<       least one RLOC with that address, and the ETR is considered 'up'.

>    LISP Nonce:
>       The LISP 'Nonce' field is a 24-bit value that is randomly
>       generated by an ITR when the N-bit is set to 1.  Nonce generation
>       algorithms are an implementation matter but are required to
>       generate different nonces when sending to different RLOCs.  The
>       nonce is also used when the E-bit is set to request the nonce
>       value to be echoed by the other side when packets are returned.
>       When the E-bit is clear but the N-bit is set, a remote ITR is
>       either echoing a previously requested Echo-Nonce or providing a
>       random nonce.  See Section 10.1 for more details.  Finally, when
>       both the N- and V-bits are not set (N=0, V=0), then both the
>       'Nonce' and 'Map-Version' fields are set to 0 and ignored on
>       receipt.
