<    RTP Sequence Number:  The receiver of an RTP flow needs to feed the
<       sequence numbers of the received RTP packets back to the sender,
<       so the sender can determine which packets were received and which
<       were lost.  Packet loss is used as an indication of congestion by
<       many congestion control algorithms.
< 
<    Packet Arrival Time:  The receiver of an RTP flow needs to feed the
<       arrival time of each RTP packet back to the sender.  Packet delay
<       and/or delay variation (jitter) is used as a congestion signal by
<       some congestion control algorithms.

<    Received (R, 1 bit):  A boolean that indicates whether the packet was
<       received.  0 indicates that the packet was not yet received and
<       the subsequent 15 bits (ECN and ATO) in this 16-bit packet metric
<       block are also set to 0 and MUST be ignored.  1 indicates that the
<       packet was received and the subsequent bits in the block need to
<       be parsed.
< 
<    ECN (2 bits):  The echoed ECN mark of the packet.  These bits are set
<       to 00 if not received or if ECN is not used.
< 
<    Arrival time offset (ATO, 13 bits):  The arrival time of the RTP
<       packet at the receiver, as an offset before the time represented
<       by the Report Timestamp (RTS) field of this RTCP congestion
<       control feedback report.  The ATO field is in units of 1/1024
<       seconds (this unit is chosen to give exact offsets from the RTS
<       field) so, for example, an ATO value of 512 indicates that the
<       corresponding RTP packet arrived exactly half a second before the
<       time instant represented by the RTS field.  If the measured value
<       is greater than 8189/1024 seconds (the value that would be coded
<       as 0x1FFD), the value 0x1FFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
<       range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable or if the
<       arrival time of the RTP packet is after the time represented by
<       the RTS field, then an ATO value of 0x1FFF MUST be reported for
<       the packet.

<    RTCP Extended Reports (XRs):  Numerous RTCP XR blocks have been
<       defined to report details of packet loss, arrival times [RFC3611],
<       delay [RFC6843], and ECN marking [RFC6679].  It is possible to
<       combine several such XR blocks into a compound RTCP packet, to
<       report the detailed loss, arrival time, and ECN marking
<       information needed for effective sender-based congestion control.
<       However, the result has high overhead in terms of both bandwidth
<       and complexity, due to the need to stack multiple reports.
< 
<    Transport-wide Congestion Control:  The format defined in this memo
<       provides individual feedback on each SSRC.  An alternative is to
<       add a header extension to each RTP packet, containing a single,
<       transport-wide, packet sequence number, then have the receiver
<       send RTCP reports giving feedback on these additional sequence
<       numbers [RTP-Ext-for-CC].  Such an approach increases the size of
<       each RTP packet by 8 octets, due to the header extension, but
<       reduces the size of the RTCP feedback packets, and can simplify
<       the rate calculation at the sender if it maintains a single rate
<       limit that applies to all RTP packets sent, irrespective of their
<       SSRC.  Equally, the use of transport-wide feedback makes it more
<       difficult to adapt the sending rate, or respond to lost packets,
<       based on the reception and/or loss patterns observed on a per-SSRC
<       basis (for example, to perform differential rate control and
<       repair for audio and video flows, based on knowledge of what
<       packets from each flow were lost).  Transport-wide feedback is
<       also a less natural fit with the wider RTP framework, which makes
<       extensive use of per-SSRC sequence numbers and feedback.
