<    TED:  The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is a collection of all
<       TE information about all TE nodes and TE links in a given network.
< 
<    TE topology:  The TE topology is a schematic arrangement of TE nodes
<       and TE links in a given TED.  It forms the basis for a graph
<       suitable for TE path computations.
< 
<    Native TE topology:  A Native TE topology is a topology that is
<       native to a given provider network.  A Native TE topology could be
<       discovered via various routing protocols and/or subscribe/publish
<       techniques.  This is the topology on which path computational
<       algorithms are run to compute TE paths.
< 
<    Customized TE topology:  A Customized TE topology is a custom
<       topology that is produced by a provider for a given client.  This
<       topology typically makes abstractions on the provider's Native TE
<       topology and is provided to the client.  The client receives the
<       Customized TE topology and merges it into the client's Native TE
<       topology.  The client's path computational algorithms aren't
<       typically run on the Customized TE topology; they are run on the
<       client's Native TE topology after the merge.
