<    Access Point Name:  The Access Point Name (APN) is a Fully Qualified
<       Domain Name (FQDN) and resolves to a set of gateways in an
<       operator's network.  An APN identifies the packet data network
<       (PDN) with which a mobile data user wants to communicate.  In
<       addition to identifying a PDN, an APN may also be used to define
<       the type of service, QoS, and other logical entities inside a
<       Gateway General Packet Radio Service Support Node (GGSN) or a
<       Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW).
< 
<    Control Plane:  The control plane carries signaling traffic and is
<       responsible for routing between the eNodeB and the Mobile
<       Management Entity (MME), the MME and the Home Subscriber Server
<       (HSS), the MME and the Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW), etc.  Control
<       plane signaling is required to authenticate and authorize the
<       mobile terminal and establish a mobility session with Mobile
<       Gateways (SGW/PGW).  Control plane functions also include system
<       configuration and management.
< 
<    Dual Address PDN/PDP Type:  The dual address Packet Data Network /
<       Packet Data Protocol (PDN/PDP) Type (IPv4v6) is used in 3GPP
<       context, in many cases as a synonym for dual stack, i.e., a
<       connection type capable of serving IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
< 
<    eNodeB:  The eNodeB is a base station entity that supports the Long
<       Term Evolution (LTE) air interface.
< 
<    Evolved Packet Core:  The Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is an evolution
<       of the 3GPP GPRS system characterized by a higher-data-rate,
<       lower-latency, packet-optimized system.  The EPC comprises some
<       subcomponents of the EPS core such as MME, Mobile Gateways (SGW/
<       PGW), and HSS.
< 
<    Evolved Packet System:  The Evolved Packet System (EPS) is an
<       evolution of the 3GPP GPRS system characterized by a higher-data-
<       rate, lower-latency, packet-optimized system that supports
<       multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs).  The EPS comprises the
<       EPC together with Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access
<       (E-UTRA) and the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access
<       Network (E-UTRAN).
< 
<    Evolved UTRAN:  The Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is a communications
<       network sometimes referred to as 4G, and it consists of an eNodeB
<       (4G base stations).  The E-UTRAN allows connectivity between the
<       User Equipment and the core network.
< 
<    Gateway GPRS Support Node:  The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is a
<       gateway function in the GPRS and 3G network that provides
<       connectivity to the Internet or other PDNs.  The host attaches to
<       a GGSN identified by an APN that is assigned to it by an operator.
<       The GGSN also serves as the topological anchor for addresses/
<       prefixes assigned to the User Equipment.
< 
<    General Packet Radio Service:  The General Packet Radio Service
<       (GPRS) is a packet-oriented mobile data service available to users
<       of the 2G and 3G cellular communication systems (the GSM)
<       specified by 3GPP.

<    Packet Data Network:  The Packet Data Network (PDN) is a packet-based
<       network that either belongs to the operator or is an external
<       network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.  The user
<       eventually accesses services in one or more PDNs.  The operator's
<       packet core networks are separated from packet data networks by
<       either GGSNs or PGWs.
< 
<    Packet Data Network Gateway:  The Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW)
<       is a gateway function in the EPS, which provides connectivity to
<       the Internet or other PDNs.  The host attaches to a PGW identified
<       by an APN that is assigned to it by an operator.  The PGW also
<       serves as the topological anchor for addresses/prefixes assigned
<       to the User Equipment.
< 
<    Packet Data Protocol Context:  A Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context
<       is the equivalent of a virtual connection between the mobile
<       terminal (MT) and a PDN using a specific gateway.
< 
<    Packet Data Protocol Type:  A Packet Data Protocol Type (PDP Type)
<       identifies the used/allowed protocols within the PDP context.
<       Examples are IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4v6 (dual stack).
< 
<    Policy and Charging Control:  The Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
<       framework is used for QoS policy and charging control.  It has two
<       main functions: flow-based charging (including online credit
<       control) and policy control (for example, gating control, QoS
<       control, and QoS signaling).  It is optional to 3GPP EPS but
<       needed if dynamic policy and charging control by means of PCC
<       rules based on user and services are desired.
< 
<    Public Land Mobile Network:  The Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is
<       a network operated by a single administration.  A PLMN (and
<       therefore also an operator) is identified by the Mobile Country
<       Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC).  Each
<       (telecommunications) operator providing mobile services has its
<       own PLMN.
< 
<    Serving Gateway:  The Serving Gateway (SGW) is a gateway function in
<       the EPS, which terminates the interface towards the E-UTRAN.  The
<       SGW is the Mobility Anchor point for Layer 2 mobility (inter-
<       eNodeB handovers).  For each mobile terminal connected with the
