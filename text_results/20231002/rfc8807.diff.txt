<        "password":  Identifies a password expiry event where the
<            password expires in the future or has expired based on the
<            "exDate" date and time.  The "exDate" attribute MUST be set
<            with the password expiry date and time.
< 
<        "certificate":  Identifies a client certificate expiry event
<            where the client certificate will expire at the "exDate" date

< 
<        "cipher":  Identifies the use of an insecure or deprecated TLS
