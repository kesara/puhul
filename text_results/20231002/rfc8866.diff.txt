<    <username>  is the user's login on the originating host, or it is "-"
<       if the originating host does not support the concept of user IDs.
<       The <username> MUST NOT contain spaces.
< 
<    <sess-id>  is a numeric string such that the tuple of <username>,
<       <sess-id>, <nettype>, <addrtype>, and <unicast-address> forms a
<       globally unique identifier for the session.  The method of <sess-
<       id> allocation is up to the creating tool, but a timestamp, in
<       seconds since January 1, 1900 UTC, is recommended to ensure
<       uniqueness.
< 
<    <sess-version>  is a version number for this session description.
<       Its usage is up to the creating tool, so long as <sess-version> is
<       increased when a modification is made to the session description.
<       Again, as with <sess-id> it is RECOMMENDED that a timestamp be
<       used.
< 
<    <nettype>  is a text string giving the type of network.  Initially,
<       "IN" is defined to have the meaning "Internet", but other values
<       MAY be registered in the future (see Section 8).
< 
<    <addrtype>  is a text string giving the type of the address that
<       follows.  Initially, "IP4" and "IP6" are defined, but other values
<       MAY be registered in the future (see Section 8).
< 
<    <unicast-address>  is an address of the machine from which the
<       session was created.  For an address type of "IP4", this is either
<       a fully qualified domain name of the machine or the dotted-decimal
<       representation of an IP version 4 address of the machine.  For an
<       address type of "IP6", this is either a fully qualified domain
<       name of the machine or the address of the machine represented as
<       specified in Section 4 of [RFC5952].  For both "IP4" and "IP6",
<       the fully qualified domain name is the form that SHOULD be given
<       unless this is unavailable, in which case a globally unique
<       address MAY be substituted.
