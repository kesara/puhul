<    Sequence Number:  A 32-bit sequence number.  The sequence number is
<       maintained on a per-source-interface basis.  Sequence numbers can
<       be used by SFs to detect out-of-order delivery or duplicate
<       transmissions.  The classifier increments the sequence number by 1
<       for each packet received through the source interface.  This
<       requires the classifier to maintain a per-source-interface
<       counter.  The sequence number is initialized to a random number on
<       startup.  After it reaches its maximal value (2^32-1), the
<       sequence number wraps around back to zero.

<    Source Interface:  A 32-bit source interface identifier that is
<       assigned by the classifier.  The combination of the source
<       interface and the classifier identity is unique within the context
<       of an SFC-enabled domain.  Thus, in order for an SF to be able to
<       use the source interface as a unique identifier, the identity of
<       the classifier needs to be known for each packet.  The source
<       interface is unique in the context of the given classifier.

<    Timestamp:  A 64-bit field that specifies the time at which the

<       formats can be used for this field: the two 64-bit recommended
<       formats specified in [RFC8877].  One of the formats is based on
<       the timestamp format defined in [IEEE1588], and the other is based
<       on the format defined in [RFC5905].
