<    Flow definition:  The concept of flow is generalized in this
<       document.  The identification fields are selected without any
<       constraints and, in general, the flow can be a multipoint-to-
<       multipoint flow, as a result of aggregate point-to-point flows.
< 
<    Monitoring network:  Identified with the nodes of the network that
<       are the measurement points (MPs) and the links that are the
<       connections between MPs.  The monitoring network graph depends on
<       the flow definition, so it can represent a specific flow or the
<       entire network topology as aggregate of all the flows.
< 
<    Cluster:  Smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire monitoring
<       network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number
<       of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.
< 
<    Multipoint metrics:  Packet loss, delay, and delay variation are
<       extended to the case of multipoint flows.  It is possible to
<       compute these metrics on the basis of multipoint paths in order to
<       associate the measurements to a cluster, a combination of
<       clusters, or the entire monitored network.  For delay and delay
<       variation, it is also possible to define the metrics on a single-
<       packet basis, and it means that the multipoint path is used to
<       easily couple packets between input and output nodes of a
<       multipoint path.
