<    Dual-stack network or device:  A network or device that has both
<       versions of the Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6) enabled and
<       operational.
< 
<    IPv6-only-capable host:  A host that does not require an IPv4 address
<       and can operate on IPv6-only networks.  More precisely, IPv6-only
<       capability is specific to a given interface of the host: if some
<       applications on a host require IPv4 and the 464XLAT CLAT
<       (customer-side translator) [RFC6877] is only enabled on one
<       interface, the host is IPv6-only capable if connected to a NAT64
<       network via that interface.  This document implies that IPv6-only-
<       capable hosts reach IPv4-only destinations via a NAT64 service
<       provided by the network.  Section 4 discusses hypothetical
<       scenarios for other transition technologies being used.
< 
<    IPv4-requiring host:  A host that is not IPv6-only capable and cannot
<       operate in an IPv6-only network providing NAT64 service.
< 
<    IPv4 on demand:  A deployment scenario where end hosts are expected
<       to operate in IPv6-only mode by default and IPv4 addresses can be
<       assigned to some hosts if those hosts explicitly opt in to receive
<       IPv4 addresses.
< 
<    IPv6-mostly network:  A network that provides NAT64 (possibly with
<       DNS64) service as well as IPv4 connectivity and allows the
<       coexistence of IPv6-only, dual-stack, and IPv4-only hosts on the
<       same segment.  Such a deployment scenario allows operators to
<       incrementally turn off IPv4 on end hosts, while still providing
<       IPv4 to devices that require IPv4 to operate.  But IPv6-only-
<       capable devices need not be assigned IPv4 addresses.
< 
<    IPv6-only mode:  A mode of operation where a host acts as an IPv6-
<       only-capable host and does not have IPv4 addresses assigned
<       (except that IPv4 link-local addresses [RFC3927] may have been
<       configured).
< 
<    IPv6-only network:  A network that does not provide routing
<       functionality for IPv4 packets.  Such networks may or may not
<       allow intra-LAN IPv4 connectivity.  An IPv6-only network usually
<       provides access to IPv4-only resources via NAT64 [RFC6146].
< 
<    NAT64:  Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to
<       IPv4 Servers [RFC6146].
< 
<    Router Advertisement (RA):  A message used by IPv6 routers to
<       advertise their presence, together with various link and Internet
<       parameters [RFC4861].
