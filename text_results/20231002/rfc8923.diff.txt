<    Transport Feature:  A specific end-to-end feature that the transport
<       layer provides to an application.  Examples include
<       confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, message-
<       versus-stream orientation, etc.
< 
<    Transport Service:  A set of Transport Features, without an
<       association to any given framing protocol, that provides a
<       complete service to an application.
< 
<    Transport Protocol:  An implementation that provides one or more
<       different Transport Services using a specific framing and header
<       format on the wire.
< 
<    Application:  An entity that uses a transport-layer interface for
<       end-to-end delivery of data across the network (this may also be
<       an upper-layer protocol or tunnel encapsulation).

<    End system:  An entity that communicates with one or more other end
<       systems using a transport protocol.  An end system provides a
<       transport-layer interface to applications.
< 
<    Connection:  Shared state of two or more end systems that persists
<       across messages that are transmitted between these end systems.
< 
<    Connection Group:  A set of connections that share the same
<       configuration (configuring one of them causes all other
<       connections in the same group to be configured in the same way).
<       We call connections that belong to a connection group "grouped",
<       while "ungrouped" connections are not a part of a connection
<       group.
< 
<    Socket:  The combination of a destination IP address and a
<       destination port number.

<    Reliability:  a boolean that should be set to true when any of the
<       following will be useful to the application: reliably transfer
<       data; notify the peer of closing/aborting; or preserve data
<       ordering.
< 
<    Checksum coverage:  a boolean to specify whether it will be useful to
<       the application to specify checksum coverage when sending or
<       receiving.
< 
<    Configure message priority:  a boolean that should be set to true
<       when any of the following per-message configuration or
<       prioritization mechanisms will be useful to the application:
<       choosing a scheduler to operate between grouped connections, with
<       the possibility to configure a priority or weight per connection;
<       configurable message reliability; unordered message delivery; or
<       requesting not to delay the acknowledgement (SACK) of a message.
< 
<    Early message timeout notifications:  a boolean that should be set to
<       true when any of the following will be useful to the application:
<       hand over a message to reliably transfer (possibly multiple times)
<       before connection establishment; suggest timeout to the peer;
<       notification of excessive retransmissions (early warning below
<       abortion threshold); or notification of ICMP error message
<       arrival.
