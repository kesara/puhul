<    Map-Version number:  An unsigned 12-bit integer is assigned to an
<      EID-to-RLOC mapping, indicating its version number (Section 6).
< 
<    Null Map-Version:  A Map-Version number with a value of 0x000 (zero),
<      which is used to signal that the Map-Version feature is not used
<      and no Map-Version number is assigned to the EID-to-RLOC mapping
<      (Section 6.1).
< 
<    Dest Map-Version number:  Map-Version of the mapping in the EID-to-
<      RLOC Map-Cache used by the ITR to select the RLOC present in the
<      'Destination Routing Locator' field of the outer IP header of LISP-

<    Source Map-Version number:  Map-Version of the mapping in the EID-to-
