<    Data channel stack:  An entity that, upon application request, runs
<       the data channel protocol to keep track of states as well as the
<       sending and receiving of data.  If the application is a browser-
<       based JavaScript application, then this stack resides in the
<       browser.  If the application is a native application, then this
<       stack resides in the application and is accessible via some sort
<       of API or APIs.
< 
<    Data channel properties:  Fixed properties assigned to a data channel
<       at the time of its creation.  Some of these properties determine
<       the way the data channel stack transmits data on this channel
<       (e.g., stream identifier, reliability, order of delivery).
< 
<    Data channel subprotocol:  The application protocol that is
<       transported over a single data channel.  Data channel subprotocol
<       messages are sent as data channel payload over an established data
<       channel.  An SDP offer/answer exchange can be used as specified in
<       this document to negotiate the establishment of data channels,
<       corresponding data channel properties, associated data channel
<       subprotocols, and data channel subprotocol properties.  In this
<       case, the data channel subprotocols may be identified by the
<       values of the 'subprotocol' parameters of the SDP "a=dcmap:"
<       attribute as described in Section 5.1.4.  Within this document,
<       the term "data channel subprotocol" is often abbreviated as just
<       "subprotocol".
