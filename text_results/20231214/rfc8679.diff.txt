<           protection schema.  E simply advertises the context ID as an
<           IP address.  P advertises the context ID and the context label
<           by using a "context ID label binding" advertisement.  In both
<           the routing domain and TE domain, the context ID is only
<           reachable via E.  Therefore, all egress-protected tunnels
<           destined for the context ID will have E as the tail end.

<           can establish an egress-protection bypass tunnel in several
<           manners (Section 5.9).  The "context ID label binding"
<           advertisement is defined as the IGP Mirroring Context segment
<           in [RFC8402] and [RFC8667].  These IGP extensions are generic
<           in nature and hence can be used for egress protection
