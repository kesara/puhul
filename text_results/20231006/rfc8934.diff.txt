<    Scheduled TE LSP (or Scheduled LSP for short):  An LSP with
<       scheduling attributes that carries traffic flow demand at a start
<       time and lasts for a certain duration (or from a start time to an
<       end time, where the end time is the start time plus the duration).
<       A scheduled LSP is also called a "temporal LSP".  The PCE operates
<       path computation per LSP availability for the required time and
<       duration.

<    Scheduled TED:  Traffic engineering database with the awareness of
<       scheduled resources for TE.  This database is generated by the PCE
<       from the information in the TED and scheduled LSP-DB; it allows
<       knowing, at any time, the expected amount of available resources
<       (discounting the possibility of failures in the future).
< 
<    Start time (Start-Time):  This value indicates when the scheduled LSP
<       is used and the corresponding LSP must be set up and active.  At
<       other times (i.e., before the start time or after the start time
<       plus duration), the LSP can be inactive to include the possibility
<       of the resources being used by other services.
< 
<    Duration:  This value indicates the length of time that the LSP
<       carries a traffic flow and the corresponding LSP must be set up
<       and active.  At the end of the duration, the LSP is torn down and
<       removed from the database.

<    B (LSP-SCHEDULING-CAPABILITY) - 1 bit (Bit Position 22):  If set to 1
<       by a PCC, the B flag indicates that the PCC allows LSP scheduling;
<       if set to 1 by a PCE, the B flag indicates that the PCE is capable
<       of LSP scheduling.  The B bit MUST be set by both PCEP peers in
<       order to support LSP scheduling for path computation.
< 
<    PD (PD-LSP-CAPABILITY) - 1 bit (Bit Position - 21):  If set to 1 by a
<       PCC, the PD flag indicates that the PCC allows LSP scheduling
<       periodically; if set to 1 by a PCE, the PD flag indicates that the
<       PCE is capable of periodical LSP scheduling.  Both the PD bit and
<       the B bit MUST be set to 1 by both PCEP peers in order to support
<       periodical LSP scheduling for path computation.  If the PD bit or
