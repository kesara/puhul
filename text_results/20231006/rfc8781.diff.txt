<    Atomic configuration:  Including the NAT64 prefix in the RA minimizes
<       the number of packets required to configure a host.  Only one
<       packet (an RA) is required to complete the network configuration.
<       This speeds up the process of connecting to a network that
<       supports NAT64/DNS64.  It also simplifies host implementation by
<       removing the possibility that the host can have an incomplete
<       Layer 3 configuration (e.g., IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but no
<       NAT64 prefix).
< 
<    Updatability:  It is possible to change the NAT64 prefix at any time,
<       because when it changes, it is possible to notify hosts by sending
<       a new RA.
< 
<    Deployability:  All IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support
<       Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] so just a minor extension to the
<       existing implementation is required.  Other options, such as
<       [RFC7225], require implementing other protocols (e.g., Port
<       Control Protocol (PCP) [RFC7225]), which could be considered an
<       obstacle for deployment.
