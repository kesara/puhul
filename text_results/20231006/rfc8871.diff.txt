<    End-to-End (E2E):  Communications from one endpoint through one or
<       more Media Distributors to the endpoint at the other end.
< 
<    Hop-by-Hop (HBH):  Communications between an endpoint and a Media
<       Distributor or between Media Distributors.
< 
<    Trusted Endpoint (or simply endpoint):  An RTP flow-terminating
<       entity that has possession of E2E media encryption keys and
<       terminates E2E encryption.  This may include embedded user
<       conferencing equipment or browsers on computers, media gateways,
<       MCUs, media recording devices, and more, that are in the trusted
<       domain for a given deployment.  In the context of WebRTC
<       [W3C.CR-webrtc], where control of a session is divided between a
<       JavaScript application and a browser, the browser acts as the
<       Trusted Endpoint for purposes of this framework (just as it acts
<       as the endpoint for DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] in one-to-one calls).
< 
<    Media Distributor (MD):  An RTP middlebox that forwards endpoint
<       media content (e.g., voice or video data) unaltered -- either a
<       subset or all of the flows at any given time -- and is never
<       allowed to have access to E2E encryption keys.  It operates
<       according to the Selective Forwarding Middlebox RTP topologies
<       [RFC7667] per the constraints defined by the Private Media in
<       Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC) system, which includes,
<       but is not limited to, having no access to RTP media plaintext and
<       having limits on what RTP header fields it can alter.  The header
<       fields that may be modified by a Media Distributor are enumerated
<       in Section 4 of the double cryptographic transform specification
<       [RFC8723] and chosen with respect to utility and the security
<       considerations outlined in this document.
< 
<    Key Distributor:  An entity that is a logical function that
<       distributes keying material and related information to Trusted
<       Endpoints and Media Distributor(s) -- only what is appropriate for
<       each.  The Key Distributor might be co-resident with another
<       entity trusted with E2E keying material.
< 
<    Conference:  Two or more participants communicating via Trusted
<       Endpoints to exchange RTP flows through one or more Media
<       Distributors.
< 
<    Call Processing:  All Trusted Endpoints connect to a conference via a
<       call processing dialog, e.g., with the "focus" as defined in "A
