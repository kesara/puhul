<    Description:  Authentication verifies the identity of DetNet nodes
<       (including DetNet Controller Plane nodes), and this enables
<       mitigation of Spoofing attacks.  While integrity protection
<       (Section 7.2) prevents intermediate nodes from modifying
<       information, authentication can provide traffic origin
<       verification, i.e., to verify that each packet in a DetNet flow is
<       from a known source.  Although node authentication and integrity
<       protection are two different goals of a security protocol, in most
<       cases, a common protocol (such as IPsec [RFC4301] or MACsec
<       [IEEE802.1AE-2018]) is used for achieving both purposes.
< 
<    Related attacks:  DetNet node authentication is used to mitigate
<       attacks related to spoofing, including the attacks of Sections
<       5.2.2 and 5.2.4.

<    Description:  Control and signaling messages can be protected through
<       the use of any or all of encryption, authentication, and
<       integrity-protection mechanisms.  Compared with data flows, the
<       timing constraints for controller and signaling messages may be
<       less strict, and the number of such packets may be fewer.  If that
<       is the case in a given application, then it may enable the use of
<       asymmetric cryptography for the signing of both payload and
<       headers for such messages, as well as encrypting the payload.
<       Given that a DetNet is managed by a central controller, the use of
<       a shared public key approach for these processes is well proven.
<       This is further discussed in Section 7.5.1.
< 
<    Related attacks:  These mechanisms can be used to mitigate various
<       attacks on the controller plane, as described in Sections 5.2.5,
