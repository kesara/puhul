<    Validation:  When using separate views or separate instances, the DS
<       records in the slaved zone will be validated as the zone data is
<       accessed by the recursive server.  When using the same view, this
<       validation does not occur for the slaved zone.

<    Caching:  When using separate views or instances, the recursive
<       server will cache all of the queries for the slaved zone, just as
<       it would using the traditional "root hints" method.  Thus, as the
<       zone in the other view or instance is refreshed or updated,
<       changed information will not appear in the recursive server until
<       the TTL of the old record times out.  Currently, the TTL for DS
<       and delegation NS records is two days.  When using the same view,
<       all zone data in the recursive server will be updated as soon as
<       it receives its copy of the zone.
