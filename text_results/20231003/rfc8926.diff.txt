<       of upper-layer protocol checksums in hardware on transmit and
<       receive, respectively.  This typically includes IP and TCP/UDP
<       checksums that would otherwise be computed by the protocol stack

<    Clos network:  A technique for composing network fabrics larger than
<       a single switch while maintaining non-blocking bandwidth across
<       connection points.  ECMP is used to divide traffic across the
<       multiple links and switches that constitute the fabric.  Sometimes

<    Tunnel endpoint:  A component performing encapsulation and
