<    Capture Device:  A device that converts physical input, such as
<       audio, video, or text, into an electrical signal, in most cases to
<       be fed into a media encoder.
< 
<    Capture Encoding:  A specific encoding of a Media Capture, to be sent
<       by a Media Provider to a Media Consumer via RTP.
< 
<    Capture Scene:  A structure representing a spatial region captured by
<       one or more Capture Devices, each capturing media representing a
<       portion of the region.  The spatial region represented by a
<       Capture Scene may correspond to a real region in physical space,
<       such as a room.  A Capture Scene includes attributes and one or
<       more Capture Scene Views, with each view including one or more
<       Media Captures.
< 
<    Capture Scene View (CSV):  A list of Media Captures of the same media
<       type that together form one way to represent the entire Capture
<       Scene.
