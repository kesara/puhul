<    xTR-ID bit (I-bit):  This bit is set to 1 to indicate that 128-bit
<       xTR-ID and 64-bit Site-ID fields are present in the Map-Request
<       message.  For PubSub operation, an xTR MUST be configured with an
<       xTR-ID and Site-ID, and it MUST set the I-bit to 1 and include its
<       xTR-ID and Site-ID in the Map-Request messages it generates.  If
<       the I-bit is set but the Site-ID and/or xTR-ID are not included, a
<       receiver can detect the error because, after processing that last
<       EID-Record, there are no bytes left from processing the message.
<       In this case, the receiver SHOULD log a malformed Map-Request and
<       MUST drop the message.
