<       elements.
< 
<    DOTS server:  is a DOTS-aware software module handling and responding
<       to messages from DOTS clients.  The DOTS server enables mitigation
<       on behalf of the DOTS client, if requested, by communicating the
<       DOTS client's request to the mitigator and returning selected
<       mitigator feedback to the requesting DOTS client.
< 
<    Call Home DOTS client or server:  refers to a DOTS client or server
<       deployed in a Call Home scenario (Figure 2).
< 
<    DOTS agent:  is any DOTS-aware software module capable of
<       participating in a DOTS channel.
< 
<    Peer DOTS agent:  refers to the peer DOTS server (base DOTS
<       operation) or to a peer Call Home DOTS client (for DOTS signal
