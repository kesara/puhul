<    version (V):  2-bit unsigned integer.  This field identifies the RTP

< 
<    padding (P):  1 bit.  If set, the padding bit indicates that the RTCP
<       packet contains additional padding octets at the end that are not
<       part of the control information but are included in the length
<       field.  See [RFC3550].
< 
<    Source Count (SC):  5-bit unsigned integer.  Indicates the number of
<       reporting source SSRCs that are included in this RTCP packet.  As
<       the RTCP RGRS packet MUST NOT be sent by reporting sources, all
<       the SSRCs in the list of reporting sources will be different from
<       the SSRC of the packet sender.  Every RTCP RGRS packet MUST
<       contain at least one reporting source SSRC.

<    Length:  16-bit unsigned integer.  The length of this packet in
<       32-bit words minus one, including the header and any padding.

<       RTCP SRs and RRs [RFC3550].  Since all RTCP RGRS packets include
<       at least one reporting source SSRC, the length will always be 2 or
<       greater.
