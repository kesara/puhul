<    Federated:  A subnet that comprises a backbone, and one or more
<       (wireless) access links, is said to be federated into one MLSN.
<       The ND proxy operation of 6BBRs over the backbone extends IPv6 ND
<       operation over the access links.
< 
<    Sleep Proxy:  A 6BBR acts as a Sleep Proxy if it answers IPv6 ND NSs
<       over the backbone on behalf of the Registering Node that is in a
<       sleep state and that cannot answer in due time.
< 
<    Routing Proxy:  A Routing Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions and
<       enables the MLSN operation over federated links that may not be
<       compatible for bridging.  The Routing Proxy advertises its own
<       link-layer address as the Target Link-Layer Address (TLLA) in the
<       proxied Neighbor Advertisements (NAs) over the backbone and routes
<       at the network layer between the federated links.
< 
<    Bridging Proxy:  A Bridging Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions
<       while preserving forwarding continuity at the link layer.  In that
<       case, the link-layer address and the mobility of the Registering
<       Node is visible across the bridged backbone.  The Bridging Proxy
<       advertises the link-layer address of the Registering Node in the
<       TLLAO in the proxied NAs over the backbone, and it proxies ND for
<       all unicast addresses including link-local addresses.  Instead of
<       replying on behalf of the Registering Node, a Bridging Proxy will
<       preferably forward the NS(Lookup) and Neighbor Unreachability
<       Detection (NUD) messages that target the Registered Address to the
<       Registering Node as unicast frames, so it can respond in its own.
< 
<    Binding Table:  The Binding Table is an abstract database that is
<       maintained by the 6BBR to store the state associated with its
<       registrations.
< 
<    Binding:  A Binding is an abstract state associated to one
<       registration; in other words, it's associated to one entry in the
<       Binding Table.
