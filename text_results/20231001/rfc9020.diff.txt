<       Mapping-server:  Maps prefixes that are not local to a SID.
<          Configuration of bindings does not automatically allow
<          advertisement of those bindings.  Advertisement must be
<          controlled by each routing-protocol instance (see Section 5).
<          Multiple mapping policies may be defined.
< 
<       Connected prefixes:  Maps connected prefixes to a SID.
<          Advertisement of the mapping will be done by IGP when enabled
<          for SR (see Section 5).  The SID value can be expressed as an
<          index (default) or an absolute value.  The "last-hop-behavior"
<          configuration dictates the MPLS Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)
<          behavior: "explicit-null", "php", or "non-php".
< 
<    Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB):  Defines a list of label blocks
<       represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels.  The SRGB
<       is also agnostic to the control plane used.  So, all local
<       routing-protocol instances will have to advertise the same SRGB.
< 
<    Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB):  Defines a list of label blocks
<       represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels reserved
<       for local SIDs.
