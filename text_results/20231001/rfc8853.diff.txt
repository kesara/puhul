<    RTP switch:  A common short term for the terms "switching RTP mixer",
<       "source projecting middlebox", and "video switching Multipoint
<       Control Unit (MCU)", as discussed in [RFC7667].
< 
<    Simulcast stream:  One encoded stream or dependent stream from a set
<       of concurrently transmitted encoded streams and optional dependent
<       streams, all sharing a common media source, as defined in
<       [RFC7656].  For example, HD and thumbnail video simulcast versions
<       of a single media source sent concurrently as separate RTP
<       streams.
< 
<    Simulcast format:  Different formats of a simulcast stream serve the
<       same purpose as alternative RTP payload types in nonsimulcast SDP:
<       to allow multiple alternative media formats for a given RTP
<       stream.  As for multiple RTP payload types on the "m=" line in
<       offer/answer [RFC3264], any one of the negotiated alternative
<       formats can be used in a single RTP stream at a given point in
<       time, but not more than one (based on RTP timestamp).  What format
<       is used can change dynamically from one RTP packet to another.

<    Codec:  This includes codec type (such as RTP payload format MIME

<       sampling affects image resolution, and temporal sampling affects
