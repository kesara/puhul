<    Nonce Length:  Two octets in network byte order, giving the length of
<       the Nonce field, excluding any padding, interpreted as an unsigned
<       integer.
< 
<    Ciphertext Length:  Two octets in network byte order, giving the
<       length of the Ciphertext field, excluding any padding, interpreted
<       as an unsigned integer.
< 
<    Nonce:  A nonce as required by the negotiated AEAD algorithm.  The
<       end of the field is zero-padded to a word (four octets) boundary.
< 
<    Ciphertext:  The output of the negotiated AEAD algorithm.  The
<       structure of this field is determined by the negotiated algorithm,
<       but it typically contains an authentication tag in addition to the
<       actual ciphertext.  The end of the field is zero-padded to a word
<       (four octets) boundary.
< 
<    Additional Padding:  Clients that use a nonce length shorter than the
<       maximum allowed by the negotiated AEAD algorithm may be required
<       to include additional zero-padding.  The necessary length of this
<       field is specified below.
