<    LSP Extended Flags:  This contains an array of units of 32-bit flags
<       numbered from the most significant as bit zero, where each bit
<       represents one LSP flag (for operation, feature, or state).  The
<       LSP Extended Flags field SHOULD use the minimal amount of space
<       needed to encode the flag bits.  Currently, no bits are assigned.
<       Unassigned bits MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
<       ignored on receipt.
