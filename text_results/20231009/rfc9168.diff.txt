<    FS-ID (32 bits):  A PCEP-specific identifier for the FlowSpec
<       information.  A PCE or PCC creates an FS-ID for each FlowSpec that
<       it originates, and the value is unique within the scope of that
<       PCE or PCC and is constant for the lifetime of a PCEP session.
<       All subsequent PCEP messages can identify the FlowSpec using the
<       FS-ID.  The values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF are reserved and MUST NOT be
<       used.  Note that [NUMERIC-IDS-SEC] gives advice on assigning
<       transient numeric identifiers such as the FS-ID so as to minimize
<       security risks.
