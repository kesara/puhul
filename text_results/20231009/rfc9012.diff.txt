<    Sub-TLV Type (1 octet):  Each sub-TLV type defines a certain property
<       about the Tunnel TLV that contains this sub-TLV.  The field
<       contains values from the IANA registry "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
<       Attribute Sub-TLVs" [IANA-BGP-TUNNEL-ENCAP].
< 
<    Sub-TLV Length (1 or 2 octets):  The total number of octets of the
<       Sub-TLV Value field.  The Sub-TLV Length field contains 1 octet if
<       the Sub-TLV Type field contains a value in the range from 0-127.
<       The Sub-TLV Length field contains two octets if the Sub-TLV Type
<       field contains a value in the range from 128-255.
< 
<    Sub-TLV Value (variable):  Encodings of the Value field depend on the
<       sub-TLV type.  The following subsections define the encoding in
