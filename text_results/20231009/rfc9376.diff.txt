<    ODU:  Optical Data Unit.  An ODU has the frame structure and
<       overhead, as defined in Figure 12-1 of [ITU-T_G709_2020].  ODUs
<       can be formed in two ways: a) by encapsulating a single non-OTN
<       client, such as SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Network /
<       Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) or Ethernet, or b) by multiplexing
<       lower-rate ODUs.  In general, the ODU layer represents the path
<       layer in OTN.  The only exception is the ODUCn signal (defined
<       below), which is defined to be a section-layer signal.  In the
<       classification based on bitrates of the ODU signals, ODUs are of
<       two types: fixed rate and flexible rate.  Flexible-rate ODUs,
<       called "ODUflex", have a rate that is 239/238 times the bitrate of
<       the client signal they encapsulate.
< 
<    ODUC:  Optical Data Unit-C.  This signal has a bandwidth of
<       approximately 100 Gbit/s and is of a slightly higher bitrate than
<       the fixed rate ODU4 signal.  This signal has the format defined in
<       Figure 12-1 of [ITU-T_G709_2020].  This signal represents the
